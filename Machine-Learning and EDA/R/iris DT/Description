#TSF Internship task 6: Supervised ML Algorithm: Decision Tree
In this task we are going to use the Iris flowers dataset to create a Decision Tree algorithm that will classify flowers into their respective species.
The Decision Tree uses Gini index and entropy to calculation information gain. The variable that gives the most information will be used as the splitting node to classify flowers.
